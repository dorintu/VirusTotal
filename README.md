The user is exposed to a function through which he can insert a path of a CSV file that contains a list of sites to test. 
The program assumes that the user will use the on-going function whenever he enters a path of a CSV file with a list of sites he wants to test. 
The sites can be: new sites that have not yet been tested, or sites that have been tested before.
